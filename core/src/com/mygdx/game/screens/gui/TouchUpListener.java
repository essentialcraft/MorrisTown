 * I've finally figured out what this class does.  The way Touchup works you need to have TouchDown set to true in order
 * for it to activate.  This will return true allowing the button to give the 'depressed' look, and allows TouchUp to active
 * Note: Even though this class is called TouchUpListener, it overrides touchDOWN  -Bill
