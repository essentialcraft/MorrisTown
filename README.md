l# Security Game Git Readme
### Update 4/15/2015

This is the most up to date version of the game yet in terms of comments and stuff. Nearly every class has been completely commented so that the entire program flow should be fairly readable.

As before is is recommended that you build a new libgdx project with the project builder. Your setup should look like this:

*edit* to match the code change Game Class to: MainClass

#Assets
Previously there were no asset files in this repository but that is no longer the case. Assets files are no included. So long as your project has the android folder you should be able to just copy paste and get everything in there.
